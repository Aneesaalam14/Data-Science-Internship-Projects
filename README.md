# Task 1 – Machine Learning Internship

This project is part of my Machine Learning Internship. I analyzed data using Python and created visualizations to find insights.

## 📁 Files

- `Task-1.ipynb`: The main notebook for this task.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- VS Code

## 📊 What I Did

- Loaded data
- Explored data
- Created graphs (bar chart, pie chart, etc.)
- Wrote some insights based on those graphs

## 🚀 How to Use It

1. Open the notebook in VS Code or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run each cell step by step.
3. Make sure libraries like pandas and matplotlib are installed.

## 🔍 My Observations

- [Write 1 or 2 points from your graphs — you can say something like:]
- Most people are in the age group 20–30.
- Gender distribution was almost equal.
