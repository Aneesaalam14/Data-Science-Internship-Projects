# Task 1 – Data Science Internship

This project is part of my Data Science Internship. I analyzed data using Python and created visualizations to find insights.

## 📁 Files

- `Task-1.ipynb`: The main notebook for this task.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- VS Code

## 📊 What I Did

- Loaded data
- Explored data
- Created graphs (bar chart, pie chart, etc.)
- Wrote some insights based on those graphs

## 🚀 How to Use It

1. Opened the notebook in VS Code or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Ran each cell step by step.
3. I made sure libraries like pandas and matplotlib are installed.

## 🔍 My Observations
